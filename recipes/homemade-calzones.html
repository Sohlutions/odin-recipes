    What is a calzone you might ask..
    Calzones are Italian turnovers that are stuffed with an array of ingredients.
    Pretty much anything that goes on a pizza can go into a calzone.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 3/4 lb. pizza dough</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour, for surface</li>
    <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pepperoni</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
 </p>

     <h5>Directions</h5>
     <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees and grease two large baking sheets with cooking spray.
        Divide pizza dough into 4 pieces.
        On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough out into an 8" circle, about 1/4" thick.
        Spoon pizza sauce in middle of dough, then dot with ricotta and top with pepperoni and mozzarella.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently fold dough in half, dampen seams with water and pinch together, then crimp edges all around.
        Repeat with remaining dough. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Brush tops with oil and sprinkle with salt.
        Using kithen scissors or a sharp knife, slit tops in 2 to 3 spots to create steam vents.
    </li>
    <li>Bake until tops are golden and filling is bubbling, 20 minutes, brushing with more oil halfway through.
        Let cool 5 minutes before cutting open.
