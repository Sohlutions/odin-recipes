    <h1>Odin Recipes to Make at Home</h1>
    <p>This website is going to contain easy to follow recipes that
        anyone.... and I mean anyone, with the proper tools and
        kitchen can make without much of any experience. I myself 
        am far from a professional chef and I have indeed made all
        of these recipes personally and have a goal of making this 
        recipe site digestible for all chefs regardless of where you
        fall on the skill spectrum. Lets get cooking!!

    <li><h2>Carne Picada Street Steak Tacos!!</li></h2>
        <p>My carne picada street steak tacos are a family favorite
            and definitely deserve the first spot on this site!
            these are fairly easy to make and very delicious for 
            just about anyone due to the versatility of the 
            ingredients. Here is the <a href="./recipes/steak-taco.html">recipe!</a>

    <l1><h2>Homemade Calzones!!</li></h2>
        <p>Another favorite in the Moore household. Delicious homemade
            calzones are the perfect lunch, dinner, or snack whenever
            you feel like you might want to cheat on your diet.
            Here is the <a href="./recipes/homemade-calzones.html">recipe!</a>

    <li><h2>Mac And Cheezeeee!!</li></h2>
        <p>Forget Kraft... make your own mac instead! This is the creamiest,
            most delicious pastas I have ever eaten! Absolute Classic.
